# üß© Eight Puzzle Solver

This project implements three classic search algorithms to solve the Eight Puzzle problem:
- *Uniform Cost Search (UCS)*
- **A* Search with Misplaced Tile heuristic*
- **A* Search with Manhattan Distance heuristic*

Developed as part of **CS205: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** under Dr. Eamonn Keogh at the University of California, Riverside (Spring 2025).

## üìå Problem Description

The **Eight Puzzle** is a sliding tile game consisting of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one blank space. The objective is to reach a **goal state** (typically tiles in ascending order with the blank in the bottom-right) from a given initial configuration by sliding tiles into the blank space.

## üöÄ Features

- Accepts custom or default goal states
  
- Allows user-defined initial states
  
- Supports three search strategies:
  - UCS (uninformed)
  - A* with Misplaced Tile heuristic
  - A* with Manhattan Distance heuristic
    
- Tracks performance metrics:
  - Execution time
  - Memory usage
  - Nodes expanded
  - Solution depth

## üìä Results Summary

Performance was evaluated on puzzles of varying depths. Key observations:

- At lower depths, all algorithms perform similarly.
- As depth increases, **UCS becomes significantly less efficient** in both time and memory.
- **A* with Manhattan Distance** consistently performs best due to its more accurate heuristic.
- All metrics were **manually tested and verified**.

|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| Uniform Cost Search (UCS)| h(n) = 0                   | ‚úÖ        | O(b^d)                     |
| A* (Misplaced Tile)      | Number of misplaced tiles  | ‚úÖ        | O(b^d)                     |
| A* (Manhattan Distance)  | Sum of tile distances      | ‚úÖ        | O(b^d), but more efficient |
